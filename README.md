## Team Roles
### 1. Backend Developer
- **Description**: Focuses on server-side logic, APIs, and integration with databases/services.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Develops and maintains the core application logic.
  - Implements security and data protection measures.
  - Optimizes performance and scalability.
 
### 2. Technology Stack
- **Technologies**: Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL
- **Django**  
  A high-level Python web framework used to build robust RESTful APIs and handle server-side logic, authentication, and routing.  
  *Why?* Provides scalability, security (e.g., CSRF protection), and a clean MVC architecture.

- **PostgreSQL**  
  A relational database system chosen for its reliability, ACID compliance, and advanced features (e.g., JSON support).  
  *Why?* Handles complex queries and ensures data integrity for user accounts, transactions, etc.

- **GraphQL**  
  A query language for APIs that enables efficient data fetching (clients request only what they need).  
  *Why?* Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data compared to REST, improving frontend performance.
